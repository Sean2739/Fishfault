# Fishfault
**Before you download:**
 - This pack is a high performance pack as this pack features CTM and 3D Models
 - If you use this pack, I would recommend turning on "Use VBO's" as it should allow you to render 3D models smoother (especially in games like TNT Run)
 - If you'd like to use a bridge overlay with this pack (other than my own) you would either have to turn off connected textures *or* use a pack that features CTM
 - If you'd like to use the smaller food models featured in this pack make sure to have 1.7 consume animation disabled
